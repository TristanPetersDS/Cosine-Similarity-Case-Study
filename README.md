# Cosine Similarity Case Study  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of **cosine similarity** to measure similarity between vectors in numerical and textual datasets. It includes:  
- Computing cosine similarity in **2D and 3D numerical spaces**  
- Visualizing similarity using **scatter plots and 3D projections**  
- Applying cosine similarity for **text analysis and string matching**  

## Key Concepts  
- **Cosine Similarity**: A metric that quantifies the similarity between two vectors by measuring the cosine of the angle between them.  
- **Numerical Data Similarity**: Calculating similarity in multi-dimensional space and visualizing the results.  
- **Text Data Similarity**: Using NLP techniques (e.g., TF-IDF) to analyze textual similarity.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn (`cosine_similarity`)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- SciPy
